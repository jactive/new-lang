<h2> C++ Code Style Guidelines</h2>

<ul>
<li> Use good OO design. Think carefully about the classes that you are
creating before you start writing code.  Use the standard library classes
and STL as much as possible.
<p>
<li> Use streams and stream operators rather than C style I/O functions,
particularly for input.  printf, however, is often easier to use for 
formated output to stdout.

<p>
<li> Always write a destructor for a class immediately after you write
a constructor; this will help you to correctly implement the destructor
code.
<p>

<li> Use good, descriptive names for class, method function, data member, 
and variables. 
<p>

<li> Pick a capitalization style for class names, method function names,
private data and methods, public data and methods, local variable names, 
constants, etc.  and stick with it.  There are some conventions for many
of these that are given below. 
<p>

<li> Avoid mixing C-style functions with C++ OO method functions.  You will
	need C-style functions, like main and main helper functions for good 
	modular design.  However, think carefully if the functionality should be
	part of a class or a stand alone C function.  If you are writing OO code,
	use good OO design to make decisions about which functionality should be 
	part of a class: what is a functionality provided by this class/object?  
	what is functionality provided by users of this object/class?
<p>

<li> Avoid using global variables; pass objects by reference instead.  Avoid
global variables and #define, and instead use static data members, 
and const as much as possible.  
<p>

<li> Avoid using multiple inheritance.  There are, of course, cases when
it should be used, but these cases are rare and you should think carefully
about other design options before deciding that this is the right one.
<p>

<li> <b>Comment your code!</b>  Every .h and .cpp file should have a 
high-level comment at the top describing the file's contents, and should
include your name(s) and the date.  In header files, write comments at top 
of every class definition describing the class in a general way.  Also, 
comment every method function (except trivial accessor and
modifier methods) describing: (1) what function does; 
(2) what its parameter values are; and (3) what values it returns.  
In source files, comment functions similarly.  Class data members should
be commented, unless their names make it obvious what they are
(by choosing good names for data members, you can avoid commenting
most of them).  In addition, any tricky code (in .h or .cpp files) 
should contain in-line comments describing what it does. 
<p>
The general rule for .h vs. .cpp comments is that .h are for the user
of the class (they don't necessarily care how the function is implemented,
they just want to be able to call the function; they need to know 
what it does, what it returns, and what to pass to it).  Comments in 
.cpp files are for someone reading the implementation of the class (in addition
to the .h file comment info, you may add more information about the algorithm
used to implement the function).  I tend to create the .h file first, add
all comments, then copy the .h to the .cpp (now I have all the function 
comments for the function implementations that will be in the .cpp and I 
only need to add additional comments about implementation).
<p>
When commenting stick to a particular style.  For example:
<pre>
	<b>// 
	// public method function: getRadius
	//   @param: none
	//   @returns: the radius of the circle in inches 
	//</b>
	float SemiCircle::getRadius() { 
	    return this-&gt;_radius;	
	}

	<b>// 
	// public method function: flipOrRotate 
	//	rotates the semi-circle by the given degree
	//	and/or flips it over its radius 
	//
	//   @param deg: the number of degrees to rotate the semi-circle
	//	  positve value will rotate clockwise
	//	  negative value will rotate counter-clockwise
	//   @param flip: if 1, flip the semi-circle over its radius
	//	   before rotating  
	//   @returns: no return value
	//</b>
	void SemiCircle::flipOrRotate(float deg, char flip) {
		...
</pre> 
<li> Deciding where to put the implementation (the .h file or the .cpp file):
Typically, short methods can be implemented in the .h file.
Methods that are implemented in the .h file can be in-lined by an optimizing
compiler, and short methods are good candidates for in-lining.  Longer methods
typically do not benefit by being in-lined so they should not be implemented
in the .h file... you want the .h file to be readable.   
<p>
<li> One way to distinguish class names from variables is to capitalize
class names, with multi-word class having each word capitalized for 
easier reading.  For example:
<pre>
	class <b>SemiCircle</b> : public <b>Shape</b> {

	};
</pre>
<p>
<li> Group data members and methods together in a logical way.  For example,
you can group all public method functions first, followed by all public
data members, then group all private functions, followed by all private
data members.  Another option is to group all functions together (all public
ones first followed by all private ones), then group all data members
together (again public ones grouped first followed by the private ones).
<p>

<li> Public methods and data members should start with a lower-case 
alphabetic character (and really you should avoid using any public data
members).
For example (note: comments have been removed here):
<pre>
	class SemiCircle : public Shape {
	    public:
		float  <b>getRadius</b>(); 
		double area(); 
		void   flipOrRotate(float deg, char flip); 
		bool   <b>inRadians</b>; 
	};
</pre>
<p>
<li> Private method functions and data members could start with an 
     underscore character to easily distinguish them from public 
     function and data members. For example:
<pre>
	class SemiCircle : public Shape {
	    public:
		float  getRadius(); 
		double area(); 
		void   flipOrRotate(float deg, char flip); 
		bool   inRadians; 
	    private:
		void  <b>_convert_to_radians</b>();
		float <b>_radius</b>;
	};
</pre>
<p>
<li> Avoid using public data members.  Provide accesser/modifier methods 
instead (if you implement these methods in the class definition, then 
any compiler can in-line their code). For example:
<pre>
	class SemiCircle : public Shape {
	    public:
		float  getRadius(); 
		double area(); 
		<b>bool   isInRadians() { return _in_radians; } // accessor method</b>
		<b>void   setRadians(bool on); { _in_radians = on; } // modifier</b>
	    private:
		void  _convert_to_radians();
		float _radius;
		bool  _in_radians;	// private data member
	};
</pre>
<p>
<li> Avoid using global variables as much as possible: values needed by
functions should be passed as parameters, and functions should return values
to the caller.  Constants and macros
should be in all uppercase <b><code>const int MAX = 100;<code></b>.  
(if you don't know what a macro is, good).
