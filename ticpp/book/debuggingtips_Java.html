<font color="red">NOTE:</font> These instructions are for using Sun's 
distribution of java (SDK) without an IDE.  If you are using some type of 
Java IDE (like Eclipse) then you should look at its documentation 
for information on using its editing and debugging features.

<h3>Compiling Java Source Code</h3>
Before the Java virtual machine (VM) can run a Java program, the program's 
Java source code must be compiled into byte-code using the  
<samp>javac</samp> compiler.  Java byte-code is a platform independent 
version of machine code; the target machine is the Java VM rather than the 
underlying architecture.  To compile a Java source code file 
<samp>Foo.java</samp>, you would do the following:
<pre>
	% javac -g Foo.java
</pre>
The <samp>-g</samp> command line option is optional, but we recommend
using it as it makes debugging easier. 
<p>
If there are no errors in your source file, the Java compiler will produce 
one or more <samp>.class</samp> files (one <samp>.class</samp> file for 
each class defined in the <samp>Foo.java</samp> source file).  For example,
the results of a successful compile of <samp>Foo.java</samp> will produce
a byte-code version of the class in a file named <samp>Foo.class</samp>.
<p>
Every public class that you write must be in a separate <samp>.java</samp> 
file where the first part of the file name is identical to the class name.  
The <samp>.java</samp> file additionally can contain code for protected 
and private classes. 
<p>
We suggest that you get in the habit of using makefiles for compiling
your Java application code.  More information on makefiles is available
<a href="javamakefiles.html">here</a>.

<h3>Running a Java application</h3>
Once you have successfully compiled your Java source code, you can invoke
the Java VM to run your application's byte-code:
<pre>
    % java &lt<samp>class with main method to run</samp>&gt [&lt<samp>command line args</samp>&gt, ...] 
</pre>
For example, to run the <samp>main</samp> method from the <samp>Foo</samp> 
class:
<pre>
    % java Foo
</pre>
Any command line arguments (arguments to <samp>Foo</samp>'s 
<samp>main</samp> method) follow the class name:
<pre>
    % java Foo 10 20
</pre>
<hr>
<a name=jar>
<h3>The CLASSPATH environment variable and JAR files</h3>

When the Java VM runs your program it searches for application 
<samp>.class</samp> files using the paths listed in your CLASSPATH 
environment variable.   To run a simple Java application, you do not 
need to set a CLASSPATH environment variable; the Java VM looks for 
classes in the current working directory by default.  However, if your 
program uses classes that are not in the current working directory, then 
you need to explicitly set your CLASSPATH environment variable to list all 
the directories containing classes used by this application.
In addition, if your program uses classes contained in a JAR (Java ARchive)
file, then the JAR file must be listed in your CLASSPATH.  A JAR file is 
a single file that contains many <samp>.class</samp> files.
<p>
After the first few weeks of class, we will start using the book's JDSL 
library, and you will need to add this library's JAR file to your CLASSPATH.
To your .cshrc file, add the following:
<pre>
setenv CLASSPATH ./:/home/newhall/public_html/cs35/book_classes/lib/jdsl_general.jar
</pre>
Each path is separated by a '<samp>:</samp>'.  In this example, CLASSPATH 
is set to two directories: the current directory (<samp>./</samp>) and 
the <samp>dsl_general.jar</samp> file.
If you have a CLASSPATH environment variable defined, then the VM uses
the paths listed in the CLASSPATH environment variable rather than searching
using its default paths.  As a result, if you set this environment variable
you need to add the current path otherwise the VM will not find classes in
the current working directory.

<H2>Debugging Java Code</H2>

If your program terminates with a thread dump, and if you are using a just-in-time compiler Java VM (by default, JDK runs as just-in-time compiler VM), then the
thread dump will likely contain lots of useless information.  To get thread
dump information in terms of your Java source code, compile with -g and run 
the Java virtual machine in all-interpreted mode using the 
<kbd>-Djava.compiler=NONE</kbd> command line argument:
<pre>
	java <b>-Djava.compiler=NONE</b> blah
</pre>
<p>
<br>Compile with -g.  This will cause the java compiler to put Java source 
code line information in .class files:
<pre>
	javac <b>-g</b> blah.java
</pre>

<h4>JDB</h4>
Use <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/tooldocs/solaris/jdb.html">jdb</a> to set breakpoints, dump thread stacks, and step through the
execution.  <kbd>jdb</kbd> has a <kbd>dbx</kbd>-like interface rather than 
a <kdb>gdb</kbd>-like interface.  Running <kbd>jdb</kbd> and typing 
<kbd>help</kbd> will provide you with information about 
<kbd>jdb</kbd>'s commands.  Here are some
commonly used commands:
<ul>
<li><tt>help</tt> to list commands for which help information is available 
<li> <code>jdb &lt;classname&gt</code>: to run JDB
<li> <code>exit</code>: to exit from JDB
<li> <code>run &lt;classname&gt</code>: to run your program from within JDB
<li> <code>run &lt;classname&gt &lt;args&gt</code>: to run your program with command-line arguments
<li><tt>stop in &lt;class-name&gt;.&lt;method-name&gt;</tt>
          <td>to set a breakpoint at the entry of the given method
  <li><tt>stop at &lt;class-name&gt;:&lt;line-number&gt;</tt>
          <td>to set a breakpoint at the given line
  <li><tt>clear &lt;class-name&gt;.&lt;method-name&gt;</tt>
          <td>to remove a breakpoint
  <li><tt>clear &lt;class-name&gt;:&lt;line-number&gt;</tt>
          <td>to delete the specified breakpoint
  <li><td><tt>cont</tt>
          <td>to continue execution after stopping at a breakpoint
  <li><td><tt>step</tt>
          <td>to execute the current statement then stop
              (if it is a method call, stops inside the called method)
  <li> <tt>next</tt>
          <td>to execute the current statement 
              (if it includes a method call, it executes the called
	       method; it does not step into the called method)
  <li><tt>step up</tt>
          <td>to execute until the current method returns

<li><tt>list</tt> to examine source code (10 lines around the current line) 
<li><tt>list &lt;line number&gt</tt> to examine source code at given line 
<li><tt>list &lt;method name&gt</tt> to examine source code at the start
of the given method 
<li><tt>print &lt;variable name&gt</tt> to pring the value of the variable
</ul>

<h4>Debugging threaded Java applications</h4>
Debugging threaded java applications with jdb is a bit ugly.  For 
threaded applications, try reducing the total number of application threads to
one or two if possible.  Also, the Thread class has some methods to help you 
debug threaded Java applications.  You can explicitly add debugging code to 
your Java program to print out information about the threads in your program.
<p>
If all else fails, add debugging output statments to your code.
