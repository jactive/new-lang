<h3>COMPILING</h3>
Use the GNU C compiler, <code>gcc</code>, to compile your C code.
Compile your code with warnings turned on (<code>-Wall</code> turns on
all warnings).  And don't ignore warnings as you compile your code; warnings
usually indicate a lurking problem that can lead to real problems later.
As you develop your code, you should compile with <code>-g</code> too; this 
will add information to the executable file that is used by gdb and valgrind.
It is a good idea to create a Makefile and use <b>make</b> to build your project code.  
<a href="howto_makefiles.html">Here</a> is some more information 
about make.
<p>
For more information about gcc make see the 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/manual/">GNU manuals</a> or run
info (the man pages for gcc and make are not very complete).
<p>
If you get undefined errors during compilation, it means either that you
have not defined a variable or function, or that the type is undefined 
(a missing header file), or that the function target cannot be found
(a linking error).
<p>
<h4>Header Files</h4>
Most header files that you include using this format:
<pre>
#include &lt;foo.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/blah.h&gt;
</pre>
are located in /usr/include/.   You can open these files to look for
type defintions and function prototypes (/usr/include/foo.h  and 
/usr/include/blah.h).  Include files often include other files, so
you may have to traverse multiple includes to find the definition you
are looking for.  Another way to find these, are to compile your pogram
with -E, to just run the preprocessor (all the #includes, #defines, etc
are expanded):
<pre>
gcc -E foo.c &gt; output
</pre>
redirect the result to an ouput file, since it will be huge, then you can
open output and see where definitions are coming from.
<p>
When you define your own header files, you should include them using this
format:
<pre>
#include "myheaderfile.h"
</pre>
You may need to tell gcc where these are located using the -I option to 
specify the include path (see the example in the linking section below).

<h3>LINKING</h3>
<p>
A common link-time error is forgetting to link library code into your 
program that uses it.  If the compiler fails at link time with a  
list of undefined symbols in your program, it is due to your not
linking in one or more .o files or library .a or .so files into
your program (if you get an undefined reference error when a file
is being compiled from .C to .o, then this means you forgot to include
a header file).
For example, if you are calling the <code>sqrt</code> function from the math
library, you need to include the math.h header file in your .C file
and you need to explicitly link the math library into your executable:
<pre>
        gcc -g -Wall -o myprog myprog.o -lm
                                        ^^^
</pre>
Most libraries are in /usr/lib/.   If not, you may need to include the -L
option to gcc to tell it where to find your library.  If you list files in
/usr/lib/, you will see that they have names like libname.so or libname.a.
To link in these libraries, use -lname.   For example, the math library is
in the file /usr/lib/libm.so (and the static version of the library is in
/usr/lib/libm.a).  To link the math library into your program you include
-lm on the gcc command line (as in the example above).
<p>
For standard C and C++ library functions, look at the man page for information
on how to link in the library code as part of the gcc command line.
For other library code, including libraries you have written, you need to
tell the linker where the library code is located.  To do this use the 
<code>-L</code> command line option followed by the path(s) to library 
code.  For example, if I have two libraries in 
<code>/home/newhall/mylibs/</code>, one of which is a shared object file named 
<code>libmymath.so</code> and the other an archive file named 
<code>libsimple.a</code>,
then I'd add the following to my makefile to link in my two libraries plus the
standard math library (this is only part of the makefile):
<pre>
# add the path to my library code; -L tells the linker where to find it
LFLAGS += -L /home/newhall/mylibs
# list of libraries to link into executable; -l tells the linker which 
# library to link in to the executable
LIBS = -lmymath	-lsimple -lm
OBJS = myprog.o

# path to any header files not in /usr/include or the current directory 
INCLUDES += -I/home/newhall/include -I../include

default: myprog

myprog:
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(LFLAGS) -o myprog $(OBJS) $(LIBS)  

${OBJS}: %.o :  %.c
	${CC} -c ${CFLAGS} ${LFLAGS} ${INCLUDES} ${@:.o=.c}
</pre>
<p>
To list symbols in .so .a .o or an executable files, you can 
use <code>nm</code> or <code>objdump -t</code> to list the contents 
of the symbol table. The output will include all symbols (e.g. functions,
global variables), and will list information about them including if they
are defined or not (defined in a .o means the code for this function or
the declaration of this global variable is in this file, undefined means
it is in some other .o, .a, or .so file). 

<p>
Executable files that are built using static linking contain
all the library code needed to run.  Executable files that are built
using dynamic linking do not contain library code from .so files.
Instead, library code from .so files is dynamically loaded into the
address space of the process at runtime.  To list the shared object
dependencies of an executable file (or of a .so file) use <code>ldd</code>.
ldd will list the name of each shared object file and the full path to
its location.  If a program fails at runtime with a linking error, it is
due to the runtime linker not being able to find one or more of 
the .so files needed to run the executable.
<pre>
	% ldd a.out 
	linux-gate.so.1 =>  (0xffffe000) 
	libX11.so.6 => /usr/lib/libX11.so.6 (0xb7e3c000) 
	libm.so.6 => /lib/tls/libm.so.6 (0xb7e05000) 
	libc.so.6 => /lib/tls/libc.so.6 (0xb7cd3000) 
	libXau.so.6 => /usr/lib/libXau.so.6 (0xb7cd0000) 
	libXdmcp.so.6 => /usr/lib/libXdmcp.so.6 (0xb7ccb000) 
	libdl.so.2 => /lib/tls/libdl.so.2 (0xb7cc7000) 
	/lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0xb7f2b000)
</pre>
If you get runtime errors like the following:
<pre>
$ ./a.out
a.out: error while loading shared libraries: libmylib.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
</pre>
this means that the runtime linker cannot find a .so file (libmylib.so in
this example).  This most often occurs when you link in shared object files 
that are not in /usr/lib, but can also occur when the a.out file was built
using libraries in /usr/lib that are no longer present when you try to run
it (often times this can be fixed by re-compiling, but may require re-installing
the missing libraries).  To fix the problem when the shared object file is
a directory different from /usr/lib, you need to set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
environment variable to include a path to .so files need at runtime.  
For example, if I put my .so files in a directory named lib in my home 
directory, I'd set my LD_LIBRARY_PATH enviroment to the following:
<pre>
  # if running bash:
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/newhall/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

  # if running tcsh:
  setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /home/newhall/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
</pre>

<h3>DEBUGGING: gdb, ddd, valgrind</h3>
(NOTE: much of this content is in an expanded form in the
<a href="https://diveintosystems.org/">Chapter 3 Dive into Systems</a>, 
a free, online textbook.)
<p>
<h3>gdb and ddd</h3>


A debugger allows you to see what is going on inside your program
as it runs and/or let you see what your program was doing when it
crashed.  gdb and ddd allow you to examine a program's
state (variables, stack frame contents, etc.), allow you to set breakpoints
to stop the program at a certain points to examine its state, and allow
you to alter the value of your program's state  (change a variable's
value, call a function) as it runs.  Learning to use a debugger can save you
hours/days of time over trying to debug via printf statements.

<h3>valgrind</h3>
valgrind is a tool for finding memory access errors in your code 
(memory leaks, reading uninitialized memory, accessing unallocated memory, 
array out-of-bounds errors, ...).  In C and C++ programs, memory
access errors are the most difficult bugs to find and to fix. valgrind can 
save you days worth of debugging effort by quickly pointing you to the
source and type of these memory access bugs in your program code.
valgrind is pretty easy to learn to use, and the effort you put in to learn
how to use it will be more than made up for by the debugging time you save 
by using it.

valgrind are available here:
