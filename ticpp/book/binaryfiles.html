		<h1> Extracting Information from .o and executable binary files<h1>
	  </h1>
				There are many tools for examining .o and a.out files.
				<p>
				<font color="blue">gcc</font> produces executable files in the 
				ELF file format.  you can use <font color="blue">readelf</font> 
				and <font color="blue">objdump</font> to read parts of an elf file. 
				You can also use <font color="blue">'hexdump filename'</font> to get 
				a hexdump of the contents of a binary file (this is likely only useful 
				if you like reading machine code or you are writing an assembler).
				<font color="blue">hexedit</font> works similarly, and
				<font color="blue">'strings filename'</font> dumps all the strings
				in the a.out or .o file.  <font color="blue">gdb</font> is also useful 
				for examining executables.
				<p>
				If you run readelf and objdump without command line arguments both
				will list the command line options.

<p> 
Here are some examples of cool things to try:

<h4>List the top-level ELF header contents:</h4>
<pre>
# list the highest level header in the ELF file
# this says that this is a ELF32 executable file, and gives 
# information about the platform for which it was compiled

% readelf -h a.out

ELF Header:
  Magic:   7f 45 4c 46 01 01 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 
  Class:                             ELF32
  Data:                              2's complement, little endian
  Version:                           1 (current)
  OS/ABI:                            UNIX - System V
  ABI Version:                       0
  Type:                              EXEC (Executable file)
  Machine:                           Intel 80386
  Version:                           0x1
  Entry point address:               0x8048350
  Start of program headers:          52 (bytes into file)
  Start of section headers:          4772 (bytes into file)
  Flags:                             0x0
  Size of this header:               52 (bytes)
  Size of program headers:           32 (bytes)
  Number of program headers:         7
  Size of section headers:           40 (bytes)
  Number of section headers:         38
  Section header string table index: 35
</pre>
<h4>List information about the different sections of the process' address space:</h4>
This lists the different sections of the process' address space that
are specified from the a.out file:
<pre>
% readelf -S a.out

Section Headers:
 [Nr] Name              Type            Addr     Off    Size   ES Flg Lk Inf A  
 ...
 [13] .text             PROGBITS        08048350 000350 00023c 00  AX  0   0 16 
 ...
</pre>
The entry above says that the .text section (most of the program's instrutions) 
should be loaded at address 0x08048350 in its address space and that the .text
section starts at offset 0x350 in the a.out file and has a size of 0x23c bytes.
(all numbers are hexidecimal (base 16)).
<p>
<h4>Disassemble the code:</h4>
You can use objdump to disassemble instructions in the a.out:
<pre>
$ objdump -d a.out

# .init contains the process initialization code 
# these are instructions that are executed first (before main)
Disassembly of section .init:
 ...

# this is where calls to functions from dynamically linked libraries
# go through:
Disassembly of section .plt:   
 ...

# this is where most of the program's instructions come from
# (code from dynamically linked libraries loaded at runtime is
#  in another section, and not in the a.out file)
Disassembly of section .text:
...

08048514 &lt;main&gt;:
8048514:       8d 4c 24 04             lea    0x4(%esp),%ecx
8048518:       83 e4 f0                and    $0xfffffff0,%esp
804851b:       ff 71 fc                pushl  -0x4(%ecx)
804851e:       55                      push   %ebp
804851f:       89 e5                   mov    %esp,%ebp
8048521:       51                      push   %ecx

...


# .fini contains instructions that are executed when a process terminates
Disassembly of section .fini:
...
</pre>
gdb can also be used to disassemble the code (use the diass command), and to 
step through the execution of individual instructions (stepi, nexti) and 
examine the values in registers.  Seem my <a href="howto_gdb.php#commands">gdb commands</a> for a few examples.
Here is an example of a gdb command to disass the main function:
<pre>
gdb a.out
(gdb) disass main
</pre>
