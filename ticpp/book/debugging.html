<h2>Debugging Tools</h2>

Debugging tools allow you to see what is going on inside your program
as it runs and let you see what your program was doing when it
crashed.  Learning to use a debugger can save you hours/days/months of 
time over trying to find and fix bugs using only output statements. 
<p>
<h4>General debuggers</h4> 
General debuggers, like gdb, allow you to examine a program's
state (variables, stack frame contents, etc.), allow you to set breakpoints
to stop the program at a certain points to examine its state, allow you
to step through the execution one instruction at a time, and allow
you to alter the value of your program's state  (change a variable's 
value, call a function) as it runs.  
gdb and ddd are debuggers you can use for C or C++ programs.
ddd is an easy-to-use GUI wrapper around an inferior debugger (gdb 
for GNU compiled C or C++ code).

<h4>Memory debuggers</h4> 
Memory debuggers find errors in how your program accesses memory.
valgrid is a tool for finding heap memory access errors in C and C++ 
programs (memory leaks, reading uninitialized memory, 
accessing unallocated memory, 
array out-of-bounds errors, ...).  
These are often the types
of program bugs that are very difficult to find, as the cause of the
bug (ex. an out-of-bounds array write), may trigger your program crashing
in a seemingly unrelated part (like reading the value of a different
variable).  Valgrind can quickly point you to the
source and type of these memory access bugs in your program code.
It is pretty easy to learn to use, and the effort you put in to learning
how to use it will be more than made up for by the debugging time you save 
by using it.

<h4>Performance debuggers</h4> 
There are also performance debugging tools. Typically, they 
collect performance data as your program runs and the data are used 
to identify inefficiencies in your program.  gprof is one example 
of a performance tool.
