When declaring and defining a function, you must use a description of the types of arguments, called function prototyping. When the function is called, the compiler uses the prototype to ensure that the proper arguments are passed in and that the return value is treated correctly. If the programmer makes a mistake when calling the function, the compiler catches the mistake.

Essentially, function prototyping is called function declaration (without naming it as such) in ch02. In a function prototype, the argument list contains the types of arguments that must be passed to the function and (optionally for the declaration) identifiers for the arguments. The order and type of the arguments must match in the declaration, definition, and function call.
  * int translate(float x, float y, float z);
  * int translate(float, float, float);
Since the compiler doesn’t do anything but check for types when the function is called, the identifiers are only included for **clarity** when someone is reading the code.

If you have an empty argument list, you can declare it as func( ) in C++, which tells the compiler there are exactly zero arguments.
In C func( ) means “an indeterminate number of arguments (which is a “hole” in C since it disables type checking in that case).
In both C and C++, the declaration func(void); means an empty argument list.

A variable argument list is represented by ellipses (...). The uncertainty of variable argument list disables the error checks of function prototyping. Because of this, you should restrict your use of variable argument lists to C and avoid them in C++ (in which, as you’ll learn, there are much better alternatives).

Quirk. **Unamed function argument**.  In C++, an argument may be unnamed in the argument list of the function definition. Since it is unnamed, you cannot use it in the function body, of course. Unnamed arguments are allowed to give the programmer a way to “reserve space in the argument list.” Whoever uses the function must still call the function with the proper arguments. However, the person creating the function can then use the argument in the future without forcing modification of code that calls the function. This option of ignoring an argument in the list is also possible if you leave the name in, but you will get an annoying warning message about the value being unused every time you compile the function. The warning is eliminated if you remove the name.

A C++ function prototype must specify the return value type of the function (in C, if you leave off the return value type it defaults to int).


Many compilers include a lot of extra functions that make life even easier and are tempting to use, but are not part of the Standard C library. If you are certain you will never want to move the application to another platform (and who is certain of that?), go ahead - use those functions and make your life easier. If you want your application to be **portable**, you should restrict yourself to Standard library functions. If you must perform platform-specific activities, try to **isolate that code in one spot** so it can be changed easily when **porting to another platform**. In C++, **platform-specific activities are often encapsulated in a class**, which is the ideal solution.

In C, an expression is "true" if it evaluates to a nonzero value. Other conditional operators are >, <, >=, etc.

A switch statement selects from among pieces of code based on the value of an integral expression. Its form is:
switch(selector) {
    case integral-value1 : statement; break;
    case integral-value2 : statement; break;
    case integral-value3 : statement; break;
    case integral-value4 : statement; break;
    case integral-value5 : statement; break;
    (...)
    default: statement;
}
Selector is an expression that produces an integral value. The switch compares the result of selector to each integral value. If it finds a match, the corresponding statement (simple or compound) executes. If no match occurs, the default statement executes.

bool is short for “Boolean,” which is a type you’ll find only in C++. It can have only the keyword values true or false.
