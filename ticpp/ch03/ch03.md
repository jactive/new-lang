When declaring and defining a function, you must use a description of the types of arguments, called function prototyping. When the function is called, the compiler uses the prototype to ensure that the proper arguments are passed in and that the return value is treated correctly. If the programmer makes a mistake when calling the function, the compiler catches the mistake.

Essentially, function prototyping is called function declaration (without naming it as such) in ch02. In a function prototype, the argument list contains the types of arguments that must be passed to the function and (optionally for the declaration) identifiers for the arguments. The order and type of the arguments must match in the declaration, definition, and function call.
  * int translate(float x, float y, float z);
  * int translate(float, float, float);
Since the compiler doesn’t do anything but check for types when the function is called, the identifiers are only included for **clarity** when someone is reading the code.

If you have an empty argument list, you can declare it as func( ) in C++, which tells the compiler there are exactly zero arguments.
In C func( ) means “an indeterminate number of arguments (which is a “hole” in C since it disables type checking in that case).
In both C and C++, the declaration func(void); means an empty argument list.

A variable argument list is represented by ellipses (...). The uncertainty of variable argument list disables the error checks of function prototyping. Because of this, you should restrict your use of variable argument lists to C and avoid them in C++ (in which, as you’ll learn, there are much better alternatives).

Quirk. **Unamed function argument**.  In C++, an argument may be unnamed in the argument list of the function definition. Since it is unnamed, you cannot use it in the function body, of course. Unnamed arguments are allowed to give the programmer a way to “reserve space in the argument list.” Whoever uses the function must still call the function with the proper arguments. However, the person creating the function can then use the argument in the future without forcing modification of code that calls the function. This option of ignoring an argument in the list is also possible if you leave the name in, but you will get an annoying warning message about the value being unused every time you compile the function. The warning is eliminated if you remove the name.
